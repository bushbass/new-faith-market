make each business editable
backend done, just frontend

fronted make individual business page and have a form to make it editable

have home page on front end only display if isPublished=true

add full details to model and display then on frontend

add categories and make sortable/searchable by category




business links from home page should go to single listing, not edit

then single page should link to edit only if owner is current user

so we need a route in app.js, a new page and a new component
